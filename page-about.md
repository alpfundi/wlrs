This is a cleaned up version of [my setup](http://execat.github.io) as a theme. So here be that theme -- I call it **[wlrs](http://execat.github.io/wlrs)**, a responsive Jekyll theme.

## wlrs is all about:

* Responsive templates. Looking good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
* Gracefully degrading in older browsers. Compatible with Internet Explorer 8+ and all modern browsers.
* Minimal embellishments. Content first --- other widget nonsense never.
* Large feature images for posts and pages.
* Simple and clear permalink structure *(ie: domain.com/category/post-title)*
